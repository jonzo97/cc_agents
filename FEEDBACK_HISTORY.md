# Orchestration Feedback History

This file tracks data-driven feedback from the agent coordination database to drive continuous improvement.

## Analysis #1: 2025-10-08 (Phase 2 Testing)

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Data Period**: Workflows from 2025-10-07
**Total Workflows Analyzed**: 9

### Performance Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Workflows | 9 |
| Completed | 4 (44.4%) |
| Failed | 5 (55.6%) |
| Success Rate | **44.4%** |

### Agent-Specific Metrics

| Agent | Total | Completed | Failed | Success Rate |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Builder | 8 | 3 | 5 | **37.5%** |
| Orchestrator | 1 | 1 | 0 | **100.0%** |

### Handoff Analysis

- **Total Handoffs**: 11
- **With Confidence Scores**: 0 (0.0%) üî¥
- **Missing Confidence**: 11 (100.0%) üî¥

**Finding**: No handoffs include confidence scores, indicating agents are not properly logging handoff data.

### Event Analysis

**Context Manager Activity**:
- context_check: 4 events
- warn: 2 events
- emergency_compact: 2 events
- compact: 1 event

**Interpretation**: Context manager has been active with warnings and emergency compactions, suggesting context pressure during testing.

### Failure Analysis

**Recent Failures** (5 total):
1. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215221_27017e) - 2025-10-07 04:52:21
2. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215221_ae8dfc) - 2025-10-07 04:52:21
3. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215221_33145a) - 2025-10-07 04:52:21
4. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215221_2bb017) - 2025-10-07 04:52:21
5. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215132_e6a29e) - 2025-10-07 04:51:32

**Pattern**: All failures involve Builder agent, clustered in time (likely same test session).

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **üî¥ CRITICAL: Missing Confidence Scores**
   - **Issue**: 100% of handoffs lack confidence scores
   - **Impact**: Cannot analyze handoff quality or trigger research at low confidence
   - **Root Cause**: Agents not logging confidence when creating handoff records
   - **Fix Required**: Update agent prompts to ensure confidence is included in handoff logs

2. **üî¥ WARNING: Low Success Rate (44.4%)**
   - **Issue**: More failures than successes
   - **Impact**: System reliability concerns
   - **Likely Cause**: Testing environment, not production usage
   - **Action**: Investigate failure patterns

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Builder Agent Failures**
   - **Issue**: Builder has 62.5% failure rate (5/8 workflows failed)
   - **Impact**: Building phase is unreliable
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Timeout issues
     - Error handling gaps
     - Test environment issues
   - **Action**: Review Builder error handling and timeout configuration

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Fix Confidence Score Logging** üî¥
   ```
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Effort: 1-2 hours

   Action: Update all agent prompts (Scout, Research, Planner, Builder) to:
   - Include confidence score in handoff reports
   - Log confidence to database when creating handoff records
   - Validate confidence is between 0.0-1.0

   Files to update:
   - ~/.claude/agents/scout.md
   - ~/.claude/agents/research.md
   - ~/.claude/agents/planner.md
   - ~/.claude/agents/builder.md
   ```

2. **Investigate Builder Failures** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   ```
   Priority: HIGH
   Effort: 2-3 hours

   Action:
   - Query events table for Builder error details
   - Review Builder prompt for timeout/error handling
   - Test Builder in isolation with known-good inputs
   - Add retry logic or better error messages
   ```

3. **Add Database Logging Validation** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   ```
   Priority: MEDIUM
   Effort: 1 hour

   Action:
   - Add database insertion checks in agent prompts
   - Verify handoff data includes required fields
   - Test database connectivity in agent initialization
   ```

#### Medium-Term Improvements (This Month)

4. **Implement Real-World Testing**
   - Test agents on actual projects (not test scenarios)
   - Collect performance data from production usage
   - Compare success rates: test vs. real-world

5. **Add Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Create alerts for high failure rates
   - Monitor confidence score trends
   - Track workflow duration metrics

6. **Optimize Context Management**
   - Review emergency_compact triggers
   - Tune context thresholds
   - Improve compaction efficiency

### Validation Status

**Phase 2 Testing Results** (2025-10-08):

‚úÖ **Working**:
- Research Agent (tested with Max for Live query - excellent 0.85 confidence report)
- Scout Agent (tested on cc_agents repo - comprehensive report generated)
- Status commands (/workflow-status, /compact-status - working with database)
- Feedback mechanism (this analysis - generating actionable insights)
- Database connectivity (Python sqlite3 working as workaround)

üß™ **Partially Working**:
- Builder Agent (works but high failure rate in test data)
- Orchestrator (100% success but limited test data)

üî¥ **Broken**:
- Confidence score logging (0% of handoffs have scores)
- Serena project activation (language error)

‚ùì **Untested**:
- Planner Agent (no recent workflows found)
- Context Manager auto-compaction
- Research Agent with Perplexity MCP

### Data Quality Notes

- **Data Source**: Workflows from 2025-10-07 (previous session)
- **Context**: Testing environment, not production usage
- **Sample Size**: Small (9 workflows) - need more data for statistical significance
- **Bias**: All failures from Builder suggest test-specific issues

### Next Analysis

**Planned**: After real-world usage on actual project
**Focus Areas**:
- Confidence score logging (should be fixed by then)
- Builder success rate in production
- Research Agent performance with Perplexity MCP
- Workflow duration metrics
