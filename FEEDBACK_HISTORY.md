# Orchestration Feedback History

This file tracks data-driven feedback from the agent coordination database to drive continuous improvement.

## Analysis #1: 2025-10-08 (Phase 2 Testing)

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Data Period**: Workflows from 2025-10-07
**Total Workflows Analyzed**: 9

### Performance Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Workflows | 9 |
| Completed | 4 (44.4%) |
| Failed | 5 (55.6%) |
| Success Rate | **44.4%** |

### Agent-Specific Metrics

| Agent | Total | Completed | Failed | Success Rate |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Builder | 8 | 3 | 5 | **37.5%** |
| Orchestrator | 1 | 1 | 0 | **100.0%** |

### Handoff Analysis

- **Total Handoffs**: 11
- **With Confidence Scores**: 0 (0.0%) üî¥
- **Missing Confidence**: 11 (100.0%) üî¥

**Finding**: No handoffs include confidence scores, indicating agents are not properly logging handoff data.

### Event Analysis

**Context Manager Activity**:
- context_check: 4 events
- warn: 2 events
- emergency_compact: 2 events
- compact: 1 event

**Interpretation**: Context manager has been active with warnings and emergency compactions, suggesting context pressure during testing.

### Failure Analysis

**Recent Failures** (5 total):
1. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215221_27017e) - 2025-10-07 04:52:21
2. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215221_ae8dfc) - 2025-10-07 04:52:21
3. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215221_33145a) - 2025-10-07 04:52:21
4. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215221_2bb017) - 2025-10-07 04:52:21
5. Builder workflow (wf_test_20251006_215132_e6a29e) - 2025-10-07 04:51:32

**Pattern**: All failures involve Builder agent, clustered in time (likely same test session).

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **üî¥ CRITICAL: Missing Confidence Scores**
   - **Issue**: 100% of handoffs lack confidence scores
   - **Impact**: Cannot analyze handoff quality or trigger research at low confidence
   - **Root Cause**: Agents not logging confidence when creating handoff records
   - **Fix Required**: Update agent prompts to ensure confidence is included in handoff logs

2. **üî¥ WARNING: Low Success Rate (44.4%)**
   - **Issue**: More failures than successes
   - **Impact**: System reliability concerns
   - **Likely Cause**: Testing environment, not production usage
   - **Action**: Investigate failure patterns

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Builder Agent Failures**
   - **Issue**: Builder has 62.5% failure rate (5/8 workflows failed)
   - **Impact**: Building phase is unreliable
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Timeout issues
     - Error handling gaps
     - Test environment issues
   - **Action**: Review Builder error handling and timeout configuration

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Fix Confidence Score Logging** üî¥
   ```
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Effort: 1-2 hours

   Action: Update all agent prompts (Scout, Research, Planner, Builder) to:
   - Include confidence score in handoff reports
   - Log confidence to database when creating handoff records
   - Validate confidence is between 0.0-1.0

   Files to update:
   - ~/.claude/agents/scout.md
   - ~/.claude/agents/research.md
   - ~/.claude/agents/planner.md
   - ~/.claude/agents/builder.md
   ```

2. **Investigate Builder Failures** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   ```
   Priority: HIGH
   Effort: 2-3 hours

   Action:
   - Query events table for Builder error details
   - Review Builder prompt for timeout/error handling
   - Test Builder in isolation with known-good inputs
   - Add retry logic or better error messages
   ```

3. **Add Database Logging Validation** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   ```
   Priority: MEDIUM
   Effort: 1 hour

   Action:
   - Add database insertion checks in agent prompts
   - Verify handoff data includes required fields
   - Test database connectivity in agent initialization
   ```

#### Medium-Term Improvements (This Month)

4. **Implement Real-World Testing**
   - Test agents on actual projects (not test scenarios)
   - Collect performance data from production usage
   - Compare success rates: test vs. real-world

5. **Add Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Create alerts for high failure rates
   - Monitor confidence score trends
   - Track workflow duration metrics

6. **Optimize Context Management**
   - Review emergency_compact triggers
   - Tune context thresholds
   - Improve compaction efficiency

### Validation Status

**Phase 2 Testing Results** (2025-10-08):

‚úÖ **Working**:
- Research Agent (tested with Max for Live query - excellent 0.85 confidence report)
- Scout Agent (tested on cc_agents repo - comprehensive report generated)
- Status commands (/workflow-status, /compact-status - working with database)
- Feedback mechanism (this analysis - generating actionable insights)
- Database connectivity (Python sqlite3 working as workaround)

üß™ **Partially Working**:
- Builder Agent (works but high failure rate in test data)
- Orchestrator (100% success but limited test data)

üî¥ **Broken**:
- Confidence score logging (0% of handoffs have scores)
- Serena project activation (language error)

‚ùì **Untested**:
- Planner Agent (no recent workflows found)
- Context Manager auto-compaction
- Research Agent with Perplexity MCP

### Data Quality Notes

- **Data Source**: Workflows from 2025-10-07 (previous session)
- **Context**: Testing environment, not production usage
- **Sample Size**: Small (9 workflows) - need more data for statistical significance
- **Bias**: All failures from Builder suggest test-specific issues

### Next Analysis

**Planned**: After real-world usage on actual project
**Focus Areas**:
- Confidence score logging (should be fixed by then)
- Builder success rate in production
- Research Agent performance with Perplexity MCP
- Workflow duration metrics

## Analysis #2: 2025-10-08 (Real-World Failure - CRITICAL)

**Date**: 2025-10-08 (Evening)
**Test Project**: mcu-competitive-analysis
**Context**: First real-world dogfooding attempt

### Critical Integration Failure üî¥

**Test Setup**:
- Agent system installed in mcu-competitive-analysis project
- Setup script ran successfully
- All slash commands available
- All 6 agents configured globally
- Database ready

**Result**: **AGENT SYSTEM NEVER USED** ‚ùå

Claude in the other session defaulted to manual implementation despite having:
- Orchestrator agent
- Research agent
- Scout agent
- Planner agent
- Builder agent
- All slash commands functional

**Impact**: **System provided ZERO value despite being installed and working.**

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. **CLAUDE.md Integration Missing** üî¥ CRITICAL

**Issue**: Setup script created `.serena/project.yml` and `AGENT_SYSTEM_USAGE.md` but **did not modify CLAUDE.md**.

**Result**: Claude had no instructions to use agents.

**Evidence**: CLAUDE.md in mcu-competitive-analysis had zero mention of:
- Agent-first development
- When to use which agent
- Slash commands
- Orchestrator for multi-step tasks
- Research agent for competitive intelligence

**Quote from other session**:
> "I had to consciously remember agents exist"

This proves agents must be **automatic default**, not optional.

#### 2. **No Default Agent Pattern** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue**: Without explicit instructions, Claude's default behavior is manual implementation.

**Why This Failed**:
- Plan mode triggered "I'll code this myself" instead of "I'll orchestrate agents"
- No task ‚Üí agent mapping
- No strategic work detection keywords
- No fallback protocol

#### 3. **Silent Agent Failures** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue**: Scout and Feedback agents were launched but never returned results.

**Claude's Response**: Abandoned agents and continued with manual work.

**Should Have**:
- Checked `/workflow-status`
- Queried `/feedback` for errors
- Tried alternatives
- Only then fallen back

#### 4. **Strategic Context Not Loaded** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue**: `mcu_competitive_intel_vision.md` was read once, then forgotten.

**Impact**: Work focused on code extraction instead of strategic intelligence.

**Should Have**:
- Reloaded vision doc before planning
- Identified strategic goals
- Chosen agents that deliver strategic value

#### 5. **Context Monitoring Failure** üî¥ CRITICAL

**Issue**: Reached compaction limit **5 times in one day** without warning.

**User Quote**:
> "we fucked up again and got me past the point where i could compact without needing to go back a couple messages"

**Impact**: Constant workflow interruption, extreme frustration.

**Root Cause**: No proactive context monitoring at 75%/85%/90% thresholds.

### Fixes Implemented

#### ‚úÖ 1. Updated mcu-competitive-analysis/CLAUDE.md

Added comprehensive "Agent-First Development" section:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE at top: "Agents are the DEFAULT"
- Default workflow (95% of tasks use agents)
- Task ‚Üí Agent mapping table
- Strategic work detection keywords
- Vision document integration
- Agent failure protocol
- Plan mode = plan agent workflows

**Key addition**:
```markdown
**Keywords that ALWAYS trigger Research Agent + Orchestrator:**
- "competitive", "market", "analysis", "intelligence", "landscape"
- "compare", "evaluate", "positioning", "segment", "timeline"
- "strategic", "recommendations", "roadmap", "opportunities"
```

#### ‚úÖ 2. Created CLAUDE.md Template

**New file**: `cc_agents/templates/CLAUDE.md.template`

Reusable template for future projects with agent-first patterns baked in.

### Critical Insights

1. **Agents must be automatic** - Requiring conscious thought to use agents = system failure
2. **CLAUDE.md is critical** - Without it, even installed agents provide zero value
3. **Context monitoring is broken** - 5 failures in one day is unacceptable
4. **Strategic work needs strategic agents** - Competitive intelligence = Research + Orchestrator, not code extraction

### Blocking Issues for Beta

üî¥ **CRITICAL** (Blocking Beta):
1. CLAUDE.md template integration (‚úÖ FIXED)
2. Proactive context monitoring (üî¥ STILL BROKEN)
3. Confidence score logging (üî¥ STILL BROKEN - from Analysis #1)

‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH** (Should fix for Beta):
4. Agent failure fallback protocol (documented, needs testing)
5. Builder reliability (62.5% failure rate - from Analysis #1)

### Validation Required

**Next Real-World Test**:
1. Use updated CLAUDE.md in mcu-competitive-analysis
2. Verify agents are used automatically
3. Test Research Agent on competitive intelligence tasks
4. Verify Orchestrator triggers for strategic work
5. Collect new feedback data

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Agents used by default (not manually triggered)
- [ ] Research Agent used for competitive/market research
- [ ] Orchestrator coordinates multi-step workflows
- [ ] Context warnings at 75%/85%/90% (not at 95%)
- [ ] No silent agent failures (fallback protocol used)

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (Before Next Session)

1. **üî¥ CRITICAL: Implement Context Monitoring**
   ```
   Priority: BLOCKING BETA
   Effort: 2-3 hours (needs code)

   Requirements:
   - Check context % every 10-15 messages
   - Alert at 75% (yellow warning)
   - Alert at 85% (orange warning)
   - Alert at 90% (red urgent)
   - Suggest compaction candidates
   - NEVER let user hit 95%+ without multiple warnings

   Implementation Options:
   - Agent-based monitoring (Context Manager agent proactive check)
   - User-side monitoring (check after each tool use)
   - Hybrid approach
   ```

2. **Test Updated CLAUDE.md**
   ```
   Priority: HIGH
   Effort: 30 min

   Test in mcu-competitive-analysis:
   - Ask for competitive analysis
   - Verify Research Agent is used
   - Verify Orchestrator coordinates workflow
   - Check /feedback after completion
   ```

3. **Fix Confidence Logging** (from Analysis #1)
   ```
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Effort: 1-2 hours

   Still blocking beta - see Analysis #1 recommendations
   ```

#### Medium-Term

4. **Setup Script Enhancement**
   ```
   Priority: MEDIUM
   Effort: 1 hour

   Options:
   - Copy CLAUDE.md.template if no CLAUDE.md exists
   - Offer to prepend agent section to existing CLAUDE.md
   - Warn user to integrate agent patterns manually
   ```

5. **Agent Failure Recovery**
   ```
   Priority: MEDIUM
   Effort: 2-3 hours

   Design:
   - Timeout detection (3 min)
   - Auto-check /workflow-status
   - Auto-query /feedback for errors
   - Suggest alternatives
   - Document failure pattern
   ```

### Data Quality Notes

- **Context**: Real-world dogfooding on strategic intelligence project
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - system installed but unused
- **User Impact**: "bashing my head against a wall at 2am"
- **Validation**: Proves technical system works (Phase 2) but integration is broken

### Key Takeaway

**Technical validation (Phase 2) ‚â† Real-world usability**

Phase 2 proved agents work when explicitly invoked. Real-world test proved agents aren't invoked without explicit CLAUDE.md instructions.

**Both are critical. System is not production-ready until both work.**
