# Deep Research: Obsidian as a Second Brain Backend for AI-Augmented Knowledge Management

## Context
I'm building a "second brain" — a personal knowledge base of tools, research topics, project ideas, bookmarks, and learning resources. Currently it's a Git repo with markdown files organized by topic. I want to evaluate whether Obsidian would be a better backend, especially considering future integration with AI agents (Claude Code), a mobile app (OpenClaw), and possibly Google Drive.

## What I Need

1. **Obsidian for developers in 2026** — What's the current state? Key plugins for developers? How does it handle code-heavy content, technical documentation, and structured data? Community size and plugin ecosystem health.

2. **Obsidian + AI integration** — How are people connecting Obsidian to AI agents? Obsidian MCP servers, RAG over Obsidian vaults, AI-powered note linking. Can Claude Code read/write to an Obsidian vault effectively (it's just markdown)?

3. **Obsidian vs plain Git repo** — For a developer who already has markdown files in Git, what does Obsidian add? Graph view, backlinks, templates, daily notes. Is it worth the migration cost? Can Obsidian work directly on a Git repo?

4. **Mobile access** — Obsidian has mobile apps. How well do they work? Sync options (Obsidian Sync vs Git vs iCloud)? How would this integrate with an eventual OpenClaw mobile interface?

5. **Obsidian + Google Drive** — Can Obsidian use Google Drive as a storage backend? Or sync to it? What about the Obsidian Google Drive plugin ecosystem?

6. **Migration path** — If I decide to adopt Obsidian, what's the migration from my current structure (topic files, bookmarks, flat hierarchy) to an Obsidian vault? Can I maintain Git tracking?

## Output Format

### Key Findings
Numbered list, each with:
- **Finding:** One sentence summary
- **Evidence:** Source/link
- **Implication for my setup:** What this means for second-brain

### Recommended Approach
- Try Obsidian: yes/no and why
- If yes: migration path and key plugins to install
- If no: what to do instead

### Constraints & Gotchas
### What Others Are Doing
### Questions I Should Be Asking

## Scope Boundaries
- Single developer, cross-device (Windows work laptop + personal phone)
- Must maintain Git compatibility (I want version history)
- Eventually connects to AI agents and possibly mobile app
- Not looking for team/enterprise features
