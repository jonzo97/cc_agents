# Known Limitations v2.2.0-alpha

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08 (Post Phase 2 Testing)

## ✅ What Actually Works (TESTED)

1. **Slash Commands** - 5 commands in `~/.claude/commands/` ✅ VERIFIED
   - `/feedback` - Performance analysis ✅ TESTED (generates actionable insights)
   - `/research <topic>` - Research Agent ✅ TESTED (excellent 0.85 confidence reports)
   - `/scout-explore` - Scout exploration ✅ TESTED (comprehensive codebase analysis)
   - `/workflow-status` - Active workflows ✅ TESTED (queries database successfully)
   - `/compact-status` - Context usage ✅ TESTED (shows usage recommendations)

2. **Research Agent** - ✅ TESTED & WORKING
   - Generates 3-5 research questions as designed
   - Uses WebSearch/WebFetch effectively (Perplexity not needed but supported)
   - Produces comprehensive reports with citations
   - Confidence scoring works (0.85 on Max for Live MIDI test)
   - 5-minute execution time as expected

3. **Scout Agent** - ✅ TESTED & WORKING
   - Follows exploration workflow correctly
   - Generates comprehensive codebase reports
   - Includes confidence scores and recommendations
   - Falls back gracefully when Serena unavailable
   - NOTE: Can hallucinate structure if not careful

4. **Database Infrastructure** - ✅ TESTED & WORKING
   - SQLite database exists with proper schema
   - 8 tables created (workflows, handoffs, events, artifacts, etc.)
   - Python sqlite3 queries work perfectly
   - Contains real workflow data (9 workflows from previous testing)

5. **Feedback Mechanism** - ✅ TESTED & WORKING (KILLER FEATURE)
   - Queries database for performance metrics
   - Identifies critical issues (e.g., missing confidence scores)
   - Generates actionable recommendations
   - Creates data-driven improvement loop

6. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides
7. **Setup Script** - Portable to new projects
8. **Serena LSP** - Connected (some activation issues)

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found (Testing) - STATUS UPDATE

### NEW: Real-World Testing (Evening 2025-10-08)

#### 1. **CLAUDE.md Integration** - ✅ FIXED (2025-10-08) **BLOCKING BETA**
   - **Issue**: Agent system installed but **NEVER USED** in real-world test
   - **Root Cause**: Setup script doesn't touch CLAUDE.md - no agent instructions
   - **Impact**: System provided **ZERO value** despite being installed and working
   - **Evidence**: mcu-competitive-analysis test - defaulted to manual implementation
   - **User Quote**: *"I had to consciously remember agents exist"*
   - **Fix Applied**:
     - Created `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` with agent-first patterns
     - Updated mcu-competitive-analysis/CLAUDE.md with comprehensive agent instructions
     - Added "Agent-First Development" section (automatic, not optional)
     - Task → Agent mapping table
     - Strategic work detection keywords
     - Agent failure protocol
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Needs validation testing
   - **Testing**: Use updated CLAUDE.md, verify agents used automatically
   - **Expected**: 0% agent usage → 95% agent usage
   - **Priority**: **WAS BLOCKING BETA** (now fixed)
   - **See**: FEEDBACK_HISTORY.md Analysis #2

#### 2. **Context Monitoring** - 🔴 STILL BROKEN **BLOCKING BETA**
   - **Issue**: Reached compact limit **5 times in one day** without warning
   - **Root Cause**: No proactive monitoring at 75%/85%/90% thresholds
   - **Impact**: Constant workflow interruption, extreme user frustration
   - **User Quote**: *"bashing my head against a wall at 2am"*
   - **Status**: 🔴 **STILL BROKEN** - Needs implementation
   - **Fix Required**:
     - Alert at 75% (yellow warning)
     - Alert at 85% (orange warning)
     - Alert at 90% (red urgent)
     - Suggest compaction candidates
     - **NEVER** let user hit 95%+ without multiple warnings
   - **Implementation Options**:
     - Agent-based monitoring (Context Manager proactive check)
     - User-side monitoring (check after each tool use)
     - Hybrid approach
   - **Effort**: 2-3 hours (needs code)
   - **Priority**: **CRITICAL - BLOCKING BETA**
   - **See**: FEEDBACK_HISTORY.md Analysis #2

### Technical Issues (Afternoon 2025-10-08)

#### 3. **Confidence Score Logging** - ✅ FIXED (2025-10-08)
   - **Issue**: 100% of handoffs (11/11) had NULL confidence scores
   - **Impact**: Blocked auto-research trigger, no performance tracking
   - **Root Cause**: Agents not logging confidence to database
   - **Fix Applied**:
     - Added "Handoff Protocol" to scout.md (v2.0 → v2.1)
     - Added "Handoff Protocol" to research.md (v1.0 → v1.1)
     - Added "Handoff Protocol" to planner.md (v1.0 → v1.1)
     - Added "Handoff Protocol" to builder.md (v2.0 → v2.1)
     - All agents now log confidence to database (never NULL)
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Needs validation testing
   - **Testing**: Run workflow + check `/feedback` for confidence scores
   - **Expected**: 0% → 100% confidence logging

### 2. **Builder Agent Reliability** - ✅ IMPROVED (2025-10-08)
   - **Issue**: 62.5% failure rate (5 out of 8 workflows failed)
   - **Impact**: Building phase unreliable, frequent timeouts
   - **Root Cause**: Timeout issues, error handling gaps
   - **Fix Applied**:
     - Added comprehensive error handling to builder.md
     - Timeout management (90% warning, graceful finalization)
     - Retry logic with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
     - Error recovery strategy by error type
     - Validation checklist before completion
     - Serena fallback instructions
   - **Status**: ✅ IMPROVED - Needs validation testing
   - **Testing**: Run build workflows, check success rate
   - **Expected**: 62.5% failures → <20% failures

### 3. **Serena Project Activation** - ⚠️ DOCUMENTED (2025-10-08)
   - **Issue**: activate_project fails with 'language' key error
   - **Impact**: Cannot use Serena tools in agents (falls back to traditional)
   - **Workaround**: Agents handle gracefully with fallback to Read/Edit/Bash
   - **Documentation**: SERENA_WORKAROUND.md created with full guide
   - **Status**: ⚠️ DOCUMENTED - Has workaround, functional
   - **Performance Impact**: ~15-20% slower without Serena (acceptable)
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM (agents work well without it)

### 4. **Scout Hallucination** - ✅ ADDRESSED (2025-10-08)
   - **Issue**: Scout reported file structures that didn't exist
   - **Impact**: Inaccurate codebase analysis
   - **Root Cause**: Inferring structure from patterns without verification
   - **Fix Applied**:
     - Added "Preventing Hallucination" section to scout.md
     - Validation checklist (verify directories/files exist)
     - Distinguish observed vs. inferred structure
     - Lower confidence for unverified reports
   - **Status**: ✅ ADDRESSED - Needs validation testing
   - **Testing**: Scout exploration + verify reported structure exists

## ❌ Not Yet Tested

### High Priority (Needs Testing)

1. **Planner Agent** - UNTESTED
   - No workflows found in database
   - Prompt exists and looks good
   - Need real-world test

2. **Orchestrator Auto-Triggering** - UNTESTED
   - Intent detection relies on Claude interpretation
   - Auto-research trigger unverified
   - Database shows 1 successful orchestrator workflow

3. **Context Manager Auto-Compaction** - UNTESTED
   - Database shows 2 emergency compacts occurred
   - Auto-compaction logic unverified
   - Manual compaction works

### Medium Priority (Documented but Not Real)

4. **Smart Compaction Preview** - Design only
   - `/compact-preview` command doesn't work
   - Semantic clustering is pseudocode
   - Would need Python implementation

5. **Context Commands** - Partially real
   - `/compact-status` works (analysis)
   - `/compact-preview`, `/compact-execute` don't exist
   - Would need actual implementation

6. **Auto-Compaction** - Not implemented
   - Context Manager prompt has logic
   - No actual automation mechanism
   - Would need background process

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Performance Metrics** - Claimed but unproven
   - 15-20% token reduction (from Serena, not Research)
   - Research timing (3-5 min) is estimate
   - Need real measurements

8. **Confidence Calibration** - Untested
   - Scout confidence scoring unverified
   - Research confidence formula theoretical
   - Need actual data

## 🤔 Uncertain (Needs Verification)

1. **Agent Invocation** - How does Claude Code actually invoke agents?
2. **Database Usage** - Do agents actually log to SQLite?
3. **Artifact Storage** - Is it working as designed?
4. **Perplexity MCP** - User has Pro, but integration untested
5. **Serena in Practice** - Works for basic ops, but in agent context?
