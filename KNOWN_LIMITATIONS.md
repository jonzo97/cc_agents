# Known Limitations v2.2.0-alpha

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works

1. **Slash Commands** - 5 commands in `~/.claude/commands/`
   - `/feedback` - Performance analysis
   - `/research <topic>` - Research Agent
   - `/scout-explore` - Scout exploration
   - `/workflow-status` - Active workflows
   - `/compact-status` - Context usage

2. **Agent Prompts** - All 6 agents configured
   - Scout, Research, Planner, Builder, Context Manager, Orchestrator
   - Prompts are well-designed and should work

3. **Database Schema** - SQLite coordination DB ready
4. **Serena LSP** - Tested, working (from Phase 2.5)
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides
6. **Setup Script** - Portable to new projects

## ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

### High Priority (Needs Testing)

1. **Research Agent** - Untested
   - Prompt exists, should work
   - Perplexity integration unverified
   - Need real-world test

2. **Orchestrator Intent Detection** - Theoretical
   - Relies on Claude interpreting prompts correctly
   - Auto-triggering unverified
   - Needs testing

3. **Agent Coordination** - Uncertain
   - Handoff protocol documented
   - No verification agents actually coordinate
   - Database logging unverified

### Medium Priority (Documented but Not Real)

4. **Smart Compaction Preview** - Design only
   - `/compact-preview` command doesn't work
   - Semantic clustering is pseudocode
   - Would need Python implementation

5. **Context Commands** - Partially real
   - `/compact-status` works (analysis)
   - `/compact-preview`, `/compact-execute` don't exist
   - Would need actual implementation

6. **Auto-Compaction** - Not implemented
   - Context Manager prompt has logic
   - No actual automation mechanism
   - Would need background process

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Performance Metrics** - Claimed but unproven
   - 15-20% token reduction (from Serena, not Research)
   - Research timing (3-5 min) is estimate
   - Need real measurements

8. **Confidence Calibration** - Untested
   - Scout confidence scoring unverified
   - Research confidence formula theoretical
   - Need actual data

## ü§î Uncertain (Needs Verification)

1. **Agent Invocation** - How does Claude Code actually invoke agents?
2. **Database Usage** - Do agents actually log to SQLite?
3. **Artifact Storage** - Is it working as designed?
4. **Perplexity MCP** - User has Pro, but integration untested
5. **Serena in Practice** - Works for basic ops, but in agent context?

## üìä Version Status

- **v2.2.0-design** ‚úÖ Complete (excellent architecture)
- **v2.2.0-alpha** üîú Tonight (Phase 1 implementation)
- **v2.2.0-beta** üîú After testing
- **v2.2.0-stable** üîú After real-world validation

## üéØ Immediate Testing Needed

1. Try `/research Max for Live MIDI` - Does it work?
2. Try "Explore this codebase" - Does Scout trigger?
3. Check `~/.claude/memory.db` - Does it have data?
4. Try `/feedback` - Does it query the database?

## üí° What Makes This Still Valuable

Even with limitations:
- **Design is solid** - Guides future development
- **Slash commands work** - Real utility
- **Setup script** - Portable
- **Documentation** - Learning resource
- **Base system works** - Serena integration proven
- **Feedback mechanism** - Will drive improvement

## üöÄ Path to Production

1. **Test** (Tonight) - Verify what works
2. **Fix** (This week) - Address failures
3. **Iterate** (Ongoing) - Feedback loop
4. **Validate** (Month) - Real-world use

Honesty is the best policy! This is a strong alpha, not a stable release.
