# Known Limitations v2.2.0-alpha

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08 (Post Phase 2 Testing)

## ✅ What Actually Works (TESTED)

1. **Slash Commands** - 5 commands in `~/.claude/commands/` ✅ VERIFIED
   - `/feedback` - Performance analysis ✅ TESTED (generates actionable insights)
   - `/research <topic>` - Research Agent ✅ TESTED (excellent 0.85 confidence reports)
   - `/scout-explore` - Scout exploration ✅ TESTED (comprehensive codebase analysis)
   - `/workflow-status` - Active workflows ✅ TESTED (queries database successfully)
   - `/compact-status` - Context usage ✅ TESTED (shows usage recommendations)

2. **Research Agent** - ✅ TESTED & WORKING
   - Generates 3-5 research questions as designed
   - Uses WebSearch/WebFetch effectively (Perplexity not needed but supported)
   - Produces comprehensive reports with citations
   - Confidence scoring works (0.85 on Max for Live MIDI test)
   - 5-minute execution time as expected

3. **Scout Agent** - ✅ TESTED & WORKING
   - Follows exploration workflow correctly
   - Generates comprehensive codebase reports
   - Includes confidence scores and recommendations
   - Falls back gracefully when Serena unavailable
   - NOTE: Can hallucinate structure if not careful

4. **Database Infrastructure** - ✅ TESTED & WORKING
   - SQLite database exists with proper schema
   - 8 tables created (workflows, handoffs, events, artifacts, etc.)
   - Python sqlite3 queries work perfectly
   - Contains real workflow data (9 workflows from previous testing)

5. **Feedback Mechanism** - ✅ TESTED & WORKING (KILLER FEATURE)
   - Queries database for performance metrics
   - Identifies critical issues (e.g., missing confidence scores)
   - Generates actionable recommendations
   - Creates data-driven improvement loop

6. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides
7. **Setup Script** - Portable to new projects
8. **Serena LSP** - Connected (some activation issues)

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found (Phase 2 Testing)

### 1. **Confidence Score Logging** - BROKEN 🔴
   - **Issue**: 100% of handoffs (11/11) have NULL confidence scores
   - **Impact**: Cannot analyze handoff quality or auto-trigger research
   - **Root Cause**: Agents not logging confidence to database
   - **Status**: Needs immediate fix
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL

### 2. **Builder Agent Reliability** - PROBLEMATIC ⚠️
   - **Issue**: 62.5% failure rate (5 out of 8 workflows failed)
   - **Impact**: Building phase unreliable
   - **Likely Causes**: Timeout issues, error handling gaps
   - **Status**: Needs investigation
   - **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. **Serena Project Activation** - BROKEN 🔴
   - **Issue**: Fails with 'language' key error
   - **Impact**: Cannot use Serena tools in agents
   - **Status**: Needs debugging
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM (agents work without it)

## ❌ Not Yet Tested

### High Priority (Needs Testing)

1. **Planner Agent** - UNTESTED
   - No workflows found in database
   - Prompt exists and looks good
   - Need real-world test

2. **Orchestrator Auto-Triggering** - UNTESTED
   - Intent detection relies on Claude interpretation
   - Auto-research trigger unverified
   - Database shows 1 successful orchestrator workflow

3. **Context Manager Auto-Compaction** - UNTESTED
   - Database shows 2 emergency compacts occurred
   - Auto-compaction logic unverified
   - Manual compaction works

### Medium Priority (Documented but Not Real)

4. **Smart Compaction Preview** - Design only
   - `/compact-preview` command doesn't work
   - Semantic clustering is pseudocode
   - Would need Python implementation

5. **Context Commands** - Partially real
   - `/compact-status` works (analysis)
   - `/compact-preview`, `/compact-execute` don't exist
   - Would need actual implementation

6. **Auto-Compaction** - Not implemented
   - Context Manager prompt has logic
   - No actual automation mechanism
   - Would need background process

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Performance Metrics** - Claimed but unproven
   - 15-20% token reduction (from Serena, not Research)
   - Research timing (3-5 min) is estimate
   - Need real measurements

8. **Confidence Calibration** - Untested
   - Scout confidence scoring unverified
   - Research confidence formula theoretical
   - Need actual data

## 🤔 Uncertain (Needs Verification)

1. **Agent Invocation** - How does Claude Code actually invoke agents?
2. **Database Usage** - Do agents actually log to SQLite?
3. **Artifact Storage** - Is it working as designed?
4. **Perplexity MCP** - User has Pro, but integration untested
5. **Serena in Practice** - Works for basic ops, but in agent context?

## 📊 Version Status

- **v2.2.0-design** ✅ Complete (excellent architecture)
- **v2.2.0-alpha** 🔜 Tonight (Phase 1 implementation)
- **v2.2.0-beta** 🔜 After testing
- **v2.2.0-stable** 🔜 After real-world validation

## 🎯 Next Steps (Post Phase 2)

### Immediate Fixes (This Week)

1. **Fix Confidence Score Logging** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Update all agent prompts to include confidence in handoff logs
   - Test database insertion
   - Validate confidence scores are recorded

2. **Investigate Builder Failures** ⚠️ HIGH
   - Review error handling in builder.md
   - Check timeout settings
   - Test in isolation

3. **Debug Serena Activation** 🔴 MEDIUM
   - Investigate 'language' key error
   - Test Serena tools in agent context
   - Document workarounds if needed

### Testing Priorities

4. **Test Planner Agent** (untested)
5. **Test Orchestrator auto-triggering** (theoretical)
6. **Real-world dogfooding** on actual project
7. **Install Perplexity MCP** (optional enhancement)
