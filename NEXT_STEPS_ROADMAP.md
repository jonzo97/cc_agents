# Next Steps: Improving the Agent Team

**Current Status**: Phase 2.5 Complete (v2.1.0)
**System State**: Production-ready, 5 agents operational, Serena integrated

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Path A: Real-World Validation (Recommended First) ‚≠ê

**Why start here**: Test what we've built before adding more complexity.

**What to do:**
1. **Dogfood the system** - Use it on a real project
   - Pick one of your actual projects (VST plugin, Max for Live, internal utility)
   - Run full Scout‚ÜíPlan‚ÜíBuild workflow
   - Document what works, what breaks, what's clunky

2. **Measure actual performance**
   - Token usage vs projections
   - Accuracy of Scout's analysis
   - Builder's code quality
   - Time savings vs manual work

3. **Identify pain points**
   - Where does it fail?
   - Where does it need human intervention?
   - What's confusing or unclear?

**Time investment**: 2-4 hours
**Deliverables**:
- Real-world test results
- Bug/improvement list
- Confidence in production readiness

**Next step after**: Path B or C depending on findings

---

### Path B: Research Agent (Phase 3)

**Why**: Complete the core agent team, enable autonomous research.

**What to build:**

#### Research Agent v1.0 (Claude-only)
- **Purpose**: On-demand deep technical research
- **Triggered by**: Low Scout confidence (<0.7), Planner unknowns, user request
- **Tools**: WebSearch, WebFetch, Grep, Read
- **Output**: Research reports as artifacts, executive summaries

**Implementation steps:**
1. Create `~/.claude/agents/research.md`
2. Define research workflows (iterative exploration)
3. Add confidence scoring system
4. Integrate with Orchestrator handoff protocol
5. Add research report templates
6. Create artifact storage for reports

**Example use case:**
```
User: "Build a Max for Live MIDI plugin"
‚Üì
Scout: Explores codebase, confidence: 0.55 (LOW)
‚Üì
Orchestrator: Triggers Research Agent
‚Üì
Research: Deep dive on Max/MSP, MIDI, JavaScript API
‚Üì
Planner: Creates informed plan with research insights
```

**Time investment**: 4-6 hours
**Complexity**: Medium
**Value**: High - fills knowledge gaps autonomously

---

### Path C: Testing & Refinement (Phase 4)

**Why**: Systematic validation of all 5 agents and workflows.

## Immediate Next Action (Right Now)

**Option 1: Real-World Dogfooding** üêï
```bash
# Pick one of your projects:
cd ~/projects/my-vst-plugin  # or Max plugin, or utility

# In Claude Code:
"Use the orchestrator agent to explore this codebase and create a plan for [feature]"

# Observe:
- Does Scout use Serena tools correctly?
- Is the plan from Planner actionable?
- Does Builder produce quality code?
- Where do you need to intervene?

# Document findings in:
/home/jorgill/cc_agents/DOGFOODING_RESULTS.md
```

```bash
# Create Research Agent
# Follow agent template pattern
# Integrate with Orchestrator
# Test on Max for Live scenario (you mentioned low confidence)

# Start with:
cat ~/.claude/agents/scout.md  # Use as template
# Create: ~/.claude/agents/research.md
```

## My Recommendation

### Start with Path A: Real-World Validation

**Why:**
1. **Validate before building more** - No point adding Research Agent if Scout/Planner are broken
2. **Uncover real issues** - Simulations miss edge cases
3. **Measure actual benefits** - Is Serena really 15% faster? Does it save time?
4. **Low risk, high value** - Just use what we built
5. **Informs next steps** - Findings guide what to build next

**How to start (5 minutes):**
1. Pick a real project you're working on
2. Start fresh Claude Code session
3. Ask: "Use orchestrator to explore this codebase"
4. Observe Scout in action (watch for Serena tools)
5. Document what happens

**Then decide:**
- If it works great ‚Üí Build Research Agent (Path B)
- If issues found ‚Üí Fix them, then test more (Path C)
- If fundamentals broken ‚Üí Hardening needed (Path D)

---

## Quick Wins (Can do in parallel)

While dogfooding, you could also:

### 1. Add Research Agent Skeleton (30 min)
Create basic `research.md` agent file, even if not fully functional. Gets the structure in place.

### 2. Improve Error Messages (1 hour)
Add better error handling to Orchestrator - clearer messages when agents fail.

### 3. Create Usage Dashboard (1 hour)
Simple script to query SQLite DB and show:
- Recent workflows
- Agent performance
- Token usage stats

### 4. Write User Guide (1 hour)
Document how to actually USE the system for common tasks:
- "How to explore a new codebase"
- "How to add a feature"
- "How to debug agent failures"

## What NOT to do (yet)

‚ùå **Don't** publish to GitHub before real-world testing
‚ùå **Don't** build Gemini integration before validating Claude version
‚ùå **Don't** add specialized agents before core 5 are solid
‚ùå **Don't** optimize prematurely - measure first
‚ùå **Don't** add complex features before testing basics

---

## Questions to Answer Through Testing

1. **Does Serena actually save 15% tokens?** (Measure in real use)
2. **Is Scout's architecture detection accurate?** (Test on 5+ codebases)
3. **Can Builder produce production-quality code?** (Code review results)
4. **Does Context Manager compact effectively?** (Monitor in long sessions)
5. **Are handoffs smooth or do they fail?** (Error rate tracking)
6. **Is the system faster than manual work?** (Time comparison)
7. **What's the actual cost?** (Token usage √ó API pricing)

---

## Success Criteria for "Ready for Phase 3"

Before building Research Agent, achieve:

- ‚úÖ Dogfooded on 3+ real projects
- ‚úÖ Scout accuracy >90% on architecture detection
- ‚úÖ Builder code passes your quality standards
- ‚úÖ Zero handoff failures in test workflows
- ‚úÖ Serena integration validated (token savings measured)
- ‚úÖ All Phase 1 & 2 tests passing
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete and accurate

---

## Your Context

Based on your background:
- **FPGA hardware engineer** learning software agents
- **Building**: Internal utilities, VST plugins, Max for Live tools
- **Pain point**: Constantly researching new frameworks/tools

**Best fit**: Path A (dogfooding) + Path B (Research Agent)

**Ideal test case**: Use Scout on a Max for Live project where you need to learn the API. See if:
1. Scout accurately maps the Max JavaScript API
2. Confidence score triggers research need
3. Research Agent (once built) can autonomously learn Max/MSP docs
4. Planner creates a realistic implementation plan
5. Builder generates working Max patch code

---

## My Specific Recommendation

**This session**: Start dogfooding
1. Pick your most active project
2. Run Scout‚ÜíPlan workflow
3. Document results (10-15 min)

**Next session**: Build Research Agent
- Based on dogfooding findings
- Use actual knowledge gaps you encountered
- Validate it fills those gaps

**Session after**: Full testing suite
- Once core 6 agents are solid
- Before publishing or major features
