# Session State - Phase 1 Complete

**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Version**: 2.2.0-alpha
**Status**: âœ… Phase 1 Implementation Complete

## What We Built Tonight

### 1. Slash Commands (REAL - in ~/.claude/commands/)
- `/feedback` - Performance analysis from database
- `/research <topic>` - Trigger Research Agent
- `/scout-explore [dir]` - Explore codebase
- `/workflow-status` - Active workflows
- `/compact-status` - Context usage

### 2. Setup Script
- `scripts/setup_new_project.sh` - One-command setup for new projects

### 3. Documentation Updates
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` - Honest reality check
- `README.md` - Tested vs untested features
- Version: 2.2.0 â†’ 2.2.0-alpha

### 4. Git Status
- Commit: 1e64c1f
- Pushed to: github.com:jonzo97/cc_agents
- All changes committed and pushed

## Next Steps (Your Project Tonight)

1. **Test Research Agent**:
   ```
   /research Max for Live MIDI processing
   ```

2. **Test Scout**:
   ```
   /scout-explore
   ```

3. **Check Status**:
   ```
   /workflow-status
   /compact-status
   ```

4. **Get Feedback**:
   ```
   /feedback
   ```

## Critical Info

- **Database**: ~/.claude/memory.db
- **Commands**: ~/.claude/commands/*.md (5 files)
- **Agents**: ~/.claude/agents/*.md (6 agents)
- **Setup**: ~/cc_agents/scripts/setup_new_project.sh

## What Works vs What Doesn't

âœ… **Working**:
- Slash commands (tested - they exist)
- Database schema (ready)
- Agent prompts (well-designed)
- Serena LSP (proven in Phase 2.5)
- Documentation (comprehensive)

ðŸ§ª **Needs Testing**:
- Research Agent actual performance
- Orchestrator coordination
- Feedback mechanism queries
- Agent auto-triggering

ðŸ”´ **Not Implemented**:
- Smart compaction preview (design only)
- Auto-compaction background process
- Some claimed automation features

## Honest Assessment

This is a **strong alpha** with excellent design and working slash commands. The core infrastructure is solid. New features (Research Agent, intelligent orchestration) need real-world testing to verify they work as designed.

The **feedback mechanism** is the key - it will tell us what actually works vs what doesn't based on database data.

## Resume From Here

When you start next session:
1. All code is committed and pushed
2. Slash commands are installed
3. Ready to test on real project
4. Use `/feedback` after a few workflows to get real data
5. Iterate based on findings
