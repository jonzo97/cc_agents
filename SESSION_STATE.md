# Session State - Phase 2 Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Version**: 2.2.0-alpha (tested)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Phase 2 Testing & Validation Complete

## What We Built Tonight

### 1. Slash Commands (REAL - in ~/.claude/commands/)
- `/feedback` - Performance analysis from database
- `/research <topic>` - Trigger Research Agent
- `/scout-explore [dir]` - Explore codebase
- `/workflow-status` - Active workflows
- `/compact-status` - Context usage

### 2. Setup Script
- `scripts/setup_new_project.sh` - One-command setup for new projects

### 3. Documentation Updates
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` - Honest reality check
- `README.md` - Tested vs untested features
- Version: 2.2.0 ‚Üí 2.2.0-alpha

### 4. Git Status
- Commit: 1e64c1f
- Pushed to: github.com:jonzo97/cc_agents
- All changes committed and pushed

## Next Steps (Your Project Tonight)

1. **Test Research Agent**:
   ```
   /research Max for Live MIDI processing
   ```

2. **Test Scout**:
   ```
   /scout-explore
   ```

3. **Check Status**:
   ```
   /workflow-status
   /compact-status
   ```

4. **Get Feedback**:
   ```
   /feedback
   ```

## Critical Info

- **Database**: ~/.claude/memory.db
- **Commands**: ~/.claude/commands/*.md (5 files)
- **Agents**: ~/.claude/agents/*.md (6 agents)
- **Setup**: ~/cc_agents/scripts/setup_new_project.sh

## What Works vs What Doesn't

‚úÖ **Working**:
- Slash commands (tested - they exist)
- Database schema (ready)
- Agent prompts (well-designed)
- Serena LSP (proven in Phase 2.5)
- Documentation (comprehensive)

üß™ **Needs Testing**:
- Research Agent actual performance
- Orchestrator coordination
- Feedback mechanism queries
- Agent auto-triggering

üî¥ **Not Implemented**:
- Smart compaction preview (design only)
- Auto-compaction background process
- Some claimed automation features

## Honest Assessment

This is a **strong alpha** with excellent design and working slash commands. The core infrastructure is solid. New features (Research Agent, intelligent orchestration) need real-world testing to verify they work as designed.

The **feedback mechanism** is the key - it will tell us what actually works vs what doesn't based on database data.

## Phase 2: Testing & Validation (2025-10-08)

### What We Tested

1. **‚úÖ Research Agent** - EXCELLENT
   - Query: "Max for Live MIDI processing and plugin development"
   - Result: Comprehensive 5-minute report with 0.85 confidence
   - Sources: 15+ official docs, recent 2024-2025 updates
   - Conclusion: **Works perfectly even without Perplexity MCP**

2. **‚úÖ Scout Agent** - WORKING
   - Tested on cc_agents codebase
   - Generated comprehensive architecture report
   - Includes confidence scores and recommendations
   - Note: Can hallucinate structure, needs validation

3. **‚úÖ Status Commands** - FUNCTIONAL
   - `/workflow-status` - Queries database successfully
   - `/compact-status` - Shows usage recommendations
   - Database has real data: 9 workflows, 11 handoffs

4. **‚úÖ Feedback Mechanism** - KILLER FEATURE
   - Generated comprehensive performance analysis
   - Identified critical issues (confidence logging broken)
   - Provided actionable recommendations
   - Created FEEDBACK_HISTORY.md for continuous improvement

5. **‚úÖ Database Infrastructure** - SOLID
   - Python sqlite3 working perfectly
   - 8 tables with proper schema
   - Real workflow data from previous sessions
   - Ready for production use

### Critical Issues Found

1. **üî¥ Confidence Score Logging - BROKEN**
   - 100% of handoffs (11/11) have NULL confidence
   - Agents not logging confidence to database
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL - blocks auto-research triggering

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Builder Agent - UNRELIABLE**
   - 62.5% failure rate (5 out of 8 workflows failed)
   - Likely timeout/error handling issues
   - **Priority**: HIGH

3. **üî¥ Serena Project Activation - BROKEN**
   - Fails with 'language' key error
   - Agents work without it (fallback to traditional tools)
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM

### Key Learnings

- **Feedback mechanism works brilliantly** - identified issues we didn't know existed
- **Research Agent exceeds expectations** - no Perplexity needed for basic use
- **Database coordination working** - agents are logging data
- **Critical gap**: Agents not logging confidence scores properly
- **Phase 2 validates design** - system architecture sound

### Documentation Created

- `FEEDBACK_HISTORY.md` - First feedback analysis with recommendations
- Updated `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` - Post-testing reality check
- Updated `SESSION_STATE.md` - This file

## Resume From Here

### Immediate Actions (Before Real Project Use)

1. **Fix Confidence Score Logging** üî¥
   - Update agent prompts to log confidence
   - Test database insertion
   - Validate scores are recorded

2. **Investigate Builder Failures** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Review builder.md error handling
   - Test in isolation
   - Fix timeout issues

3. **Test Planner Agent** üß™
   - Currently untested (no workflows found)
   - Needed for complete workflow validation

### Ready For

- Real-world dogfooding on your project
- Collecting more feedback data
- Iterating based on findings
- Beta release after fixes
